# PawthereumTweetBot
The goal of this repo is to create an engaging twitterbot that tweets about all things Pawthereum.
This could include:
 - $PAWTH prices
 - Holder statistics
 - Twitter status changes
 - ...

This is a public & open source repo. Feel free to add any functionality, comments, ...

Inspiration for this repo comes from https://twitter.com/SafeMoonNewsBot. Make sure to give this cool bot a follow.

## How to use
Make sure you have a recent version of Python on your machine. It could be that you have to install some packages to meet all dependencies.
```
python pawthBot.py
```

A few notes:
 - By default the twitter authentication keys are not provided. Running this code out of the box will just print anything that would be tweeted in the terminal prompt.

  - You can set up your own twitter account and fill in the authentication keys in a file authentication_keys.py. The template is provided in ```authentication_keys_template.py```.
