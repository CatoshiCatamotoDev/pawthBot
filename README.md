# PawthereumStatBots
The goal of this repo is to create a framework from which engaging bots can be made (twitter, telegram, ...).
The bots can then use the generated data to tweet interesting statistics about Pawthereum, post regular updates in Telegram channels or respond to requests...
The goal is to gather as many interesting statistics as possible that can then be distributed.

This is a public & open source repo. Feel free to add any functionality, comments, ...

Inspiration for this repo comes from https://twitter.com/SafeMoonNewsBot. Make sure to give this cool bot a follow.

## How to use
Make sure you have a recent version of Python on your machine. It could be that you have to install some packages to meet all dependencies.
```
python pawthBot.py

A few notes:
 - By default the twitter authentication keys are not provided. Running this code out of the box will just print anything that would be tweeted in the terminal prompt.

  - You can set up your own twitter account and fill in the authentication keys in a file authentication_keys.py. The template is provided in ```authentication_keys_template.py```.
